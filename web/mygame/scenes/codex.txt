        Anwen is well known for her ingenuity. Being of elven heritage, she has intensive knowledge on how to care for animals and how to shoot a bow. She can be often seen taking care of the horses or being with the wild life. She is also the champion of the Wolves’ yearly archery competition. However, her true love is tinkering, having created and upgraded many of the weapons used by the Wolves.
        
        Before she joined the Wolves, she was a craftsman in her village. Leaving to pursue her career she got caught up with some bandits. She was surrounded when the wolves came by to save her, only for her to take down a good number of them herself. Impressed by her skills, they offered her a place amongst their ranks. The Wolves could use a tinkerer along with a skilled marksman. She agreed after being promised that she can handle outfitting and modifying the team’s weaponry.
        
        She may have a quick temper and is heavily sarcastic, but she is immensely loyal. Saving the Wolves on multiple accounts and requesting that they went back to her village to save them from an attack. She is a valued member of the Wolves of Davenport.

        *image images/Cel_Storm.webp
        Cel Storm is a priestess of the Flames of Sigel. She joined the order at a young age when a priest named Dustin saved her from icgor-swogs. The rotted creatures overwhelmed her old town. She was one of the few survivors when the Flames of Sigil showed up. Cel managed to hide herself in an old storage shed and used the holy water her parents gave her to protect herself. Dustin was the one who found her and took her to the order’s temple.
        
        She is seen helping anyone who needs help, much to the dismay of the order. She followed Dustin’s footsteps in that regard. She doesn’t care who you are or where you came from, if you need help she will find a way to help. She has been seen saving people from Krigania from the jackaloids and mogfish.
        
        When her mentor Dustin was killed because some direwolves were forced out of their territory. Cel did some research on direwolves and partitioned a new branch in the order. One that patrolled towns near direwolf territories. She didn’t want these wolves to hurt anyone else.

    #Dustin
        [head]Dustin[/head]
        Dustin was the priest that took Cel Storm to the Flames of Sigel’s temple. He is the one who took care of her during her childhood after her town was taken over by ichor-swogs.
        
        He was known for taking in strays even before his wife died. She always talked about how the order should protect and help the people who have lost their homes to the rot. Not many people she took in made it far in the order, and most would leave after getting back on their feet. Some will stay and fully join the order, but they don’t make it far. This didn’t sway her. She was always a kind person and Dustin loved that about her. After she died Dustin continued to help people to honor her memory. 
        
        When he brought Cel in, he treated her like his own. The priests thinks she reminded him of his wife. He helped her get accommodated to the temple and got her a private tutor to help her along. Cel grew to look up to him and did her best to make him proud. In return, Dustin tried to be the kind of role model she needed. 
        
        Dustin died to a direwolf attack when he was patrolling the towns along the rot border. The direwolves got pushed out of their territory by the rot and attacked a nearby town. From what Cel said, he was protecting a family when the direwolves got him.

        No one is completely sure where Elena came from. The Wolves of Davenport found her during one of her travels. She used arcane powers to help them destroy the rot in a small village. After seeing everyone work together and how everyone cared for each other, she joined the Wolves. Her knowledge and observation skills became vital for scouting missions.
        
        The little that is known about her past is that she used to travel with someone before they left her. It is unknown what had happened, but it clearly hurt Elena. She spends long periods alone on the edge of town, or camp, engrossed in meditative thought. There are also cities that she refuses to go into as she has many unseen enemies within them.

He was well known for his knowledge of medicine, his parents were so proud of him that they made an announcement  when he got into the college of Farwater, the one of the best colleges in the land. It was a surprise to everyone when he got kicked out and his parents disowned him. They did not give an official reason why, but rumors say he was using unethical practices in his experiments.
        
        This did not deter him and he became a traveling medic, helping those who needed it. Although he never changed in his ways, he knew how to cure poisons that many gave up on. When he ran into the Wolves, one of them was injured. They got hit by a poisoned dart from a particularly crafty brigand. Gwyn managed to cure them and the Wolves asked him to join. Gwyn was reluctant at first, but after discovering he was free to run his experiments, he willingly joined. He became the poisons expert along with one of the top healers. Sharing his knowledge and having the freedom to experiment as he feels fit helped him grow and save many lives.

        Leon “Silvertoung” Hartley was a well known raconteur before he joined the Wolves of Davenport. Known as "The Enigmatic Raconteur," he traveled throughout Terville and told stories of the people he had encountered. Stories about brave warriors in battle or stories of powerful monsters meeting their end. Sometimes he’ll tell stories of love and heartbreak, other times he’ll tell popular stories with his own twist on them. His more recent stories have hopeful endings that are used to inspire others. However, it wasn’t always like that.
        
        It is unknown how he got the skills he has. Leon is one of the most dangerous members of the Wolves. His skills with the blade is unmatched even with the most skilled swordsman. He seems to know how to sneak himself into any location, no matter how well guarded. Whenever his background is brought up he will either talk about the nomadic storytellers who raised him or completely deflect the question all together. Only a select few know his full story.

        Reese is my neighbor down the street. The two of us go sword fighting near the edge of the woods, our parents don’t like it when we go there. They help me and my mother farm while their parents are out of town for work. They say they work with my father in Davenport. I wonder if they get any of that Dwarven bread.
        
        Reese wants to explore more of the forest, I do not want to go. Our parents do not want us to go, they tell us it is too dangerous. That there are huge mockgardens and scary creatures out there. I do not want to see the big scary creatures, but I want to play with my friend.

The closest temple equipped to help was many weeks out and Reese only had two weeks before the end. The full story of what happened is unknown, but the priest explained that he put the child out of his misery before the end came. When Reese’s parents found out, they moved to Davenport to spend the rest of their time working with the fishermen.

        Skadon, known as "The Father of Oblivion," emerged from the primordial void, a sentient force embodying darkness and the void itself. As the clash between Skadon and Sigel, the sun god, raged, the chaotic magic within creation stirred. Tera, the goddess of beauty, fertility, and "Mother Earth," manifested as the physical world of Teren. In another realm, Galdor, the embodiment of magic's will, brought order to the once chaotic forces.
        
        Recognizing the fragility of life on Teren, Tera sought Sigel's protection, showing him the burgeoning life on the planet's surface. Impressed by mankind's potential, Sigel proposed a union with Tera to safeguard Teren from Skadon's encroaching darkness. The cosmic balance began to stabilize, with Galdor controlling magic, while Skadon and Sigel's clash birthed other celestial beings and deities.
        
        Skadon, as the God of Darkness and The Void, represents the ever-present threat of oblivion. His eternal conflict with Sigel shapes the world of Teren, while Tera nurtures life and Galdor tames the forces of magic. Within this delicate equilibrium, Lune, the goddess of the moon, and other deities emerged. The struggle between light and darkness remains an enduring theme, influencing the destiny of Teren and its inhabitants throughout time.

        The Direwolf, a creature of awe-inspiring stature and intelligence, reigns as a formidable presence within the realms it calls home. Far surpassing the mere size of their smaller kin, these majestic beings exhibit a level of intelligence that sets them apart from regular wolves. Scholars and druids alike attest to their heightened cognitive abilities, recognizing them as remarkable beings in the animal kingdom.
        
        The Direwolf's imposing physique and strength make it a force to be reckoned with. Legends recount tales of these colossal creatures engaging in solitary hunts, where they display their formidable prowess by taking down powerful adversaries such as warhorses. Come morning, all that remains are the mere skeletal remnants of their prey.
        
        While solitary hunters by nature, it is not uncommon to hear accounts of a Direwolf taking command of a troublesome wolfpack, effectively becoming their dominant leader. In extremely rare instances, reports suggest the existence of a fully-fledged Direwolf pack. However, such occurrences are scarcely recorded due to the astronomical demands of sustaining a group of such large predators.
        
        Possessing the resilience of a bear and the cunning pack tactics of a wolf, encounters with a Direwolf can quickly escalate into perilous situations. Travelers who find themselves within the hunting territory of these creatures are strongly advised to take the shortest and quickest route out of the area. If possible, seeking refuge behind fortified structures with capable defenders is strongly recommended. It is believed that Direwolves, with their heightened intellect, are known to hold grudges and may relentlessly pursue those who have wronged them.
        
        Despite their fearsome reputation, there exist rare tales of a human forming a bond of mutual respect and trust with a Direwolf. In extreme and exceptional circumstances, when a human has proven their mettle and earned the respect of the imposing creature, a Direwolf may allow itself to be tamed. These extraordinary alliances between man and beast serve as testaments to the depth of connection and loyalty that can transcend the boundaries of species.
        
        The Direwolf, a creature of immense power, intelligence, and strategic prowess, commands respect and captivates the imagination. Their imposing presence in the natural world serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between fear and admiration. Whether viewed as formidable adversaries or as potential allies, the Direwolf continues to inspire awe and reverence in those who encounter them, forever etching their legacy in the annals of folklore and exploration.

        The Ichor-Swag, an abominable creature spawned from the depths of corruption, is a testament to the dark forces that pervade the natural world. Emerging from the festering wounds of blighted trees, these cursed beings embody the malevolence that feasts upon the vitality of their surroundings. Although individually feeble, they compensate for their weakness through sheer numbers, swarming together to unleash havoc should the blight go unchecked. Measuring no larger than the heel of a boot, the Ichor-Swag possesses a repulsive appearance. Their grotesque forms are an amalgamation of oozing sap, corrupted flesh, and a sickly aura that resonates with necrotic energy. Their bites transmit a blighted sickness, spreading further devastation within their victims. It is vital to employ fire and holy water when confronting these creatures, as the cleansing power of these elements proves most effective against the darkness that empowers them.
        
        Bright lights, such as flames or holy energy, strike fear into the hearts of Ichor-Swags. This aversion to luminosity can be harnessed to advantage by utilizing fire or holy energy to flush them out from the epicenter of rot, typically a diseased tree, and expose them to the purifying light of day. By doing so, their extermination becomes more manageable, and the threat they pose can be mitigated, allowing the process of healing to begin for the blighted landscape.
        
        Caution must be exercised when dealing with these creatures and their originating blights. The Ichor-Swag, born from the decay and maleficence of the natural world, serves as a haunting reminder of the relentless struggle between light and darkness, and the delicate balance upon which the harmony of existence hangs

        *image images/Jackaloid.webp
        The Manned Jackaloids are small, werewolf-like creatures that inhabit remote regions far from civilized settlements. Standing between 3 and a half to just under 5 feet tall, they operate in packs, using their presence to frighten away other predators from potential prey and scavenging off decaying carcasses. Despite their frail and lesion-ridden appearance, these creatures exhibit surprising resilience.  
        
        Afflicted by an augmented form of leprosy, the Manned Jackaloids are not true lycanthropes in the traditional sense. However, their bites not only spread mundane leprosy to the small hamlets they afflict but also transmit their augmented leprosy to humanoids below the age of physical maturity. The symptoms of this sickness resemble the ordinary affliction, but upon death, the victim's sores widen to unveil a hide of matted fur beneath the skin, transforming them into one of these Jackaloids. This transformation stunts their natural growth, rendering the Jackaloid permanently the size of its host. 
        
        Encounters with these beasts warrant caution, as their infectious nature poses a grave threat. It is advised for individuals to carry an ample supply of healing potions and promptly seek the aid of experienced apothecaries or temples for treatment if bitten. Preemptive measures and swift medical attention are crucial to mitigate the spread of the augmented leprosy and its dire consequences.   
        
        The presence of Maned Jackaloids serves as a grim reminder of the perils lurking in the untamed corners of the world. Their unique affliction, contagious nature, and predatory behavior make them a formidable and unsettling force. Knowledge and vigilance are key to protecting oneself and the communities at risk from these enigmatic and dangerous creatures

        [head]Mockguarden[/head]
        *image images/Mockgarden_Closeup.webp
        The Mockguarden, a perilous and cunning predator, is a formidable form of predatory plant that lurks within the depths of untamed forests. With its ability to adapt and camouflage, it poses a significant threat to unsuspecting creatures that venture too close. While its visible parts may change and blend with the surroundings, it is the subterranean mycelium network that truly defines this enigmatic entity.
        
        Beneath the earth's surface lies a vast mycelium network, a sprawling and semi-sentient entity that forms the core of the Mockguarden. This underground network, often circular and measuring between 10 to 20 feet in diameter, serves as the life force and intelligence of this peculiar organism. From this hidden realm, the Mockguarden orchestrates its sinister tactics.
        
        The Mockguarden patiently positions itself in areas of high traffic, such as game trails and footpaths, where it awaits an unsuspecting creature to step upon its mycelium-covered surface. In an instant, the Mockguarden springs into action, employing a variety of deadly mechanisms to subdue its prey. Fungal tentacles, coated in acidic spores, lash out to ensnare and immobilize the unfortunate victim. Additionally, the Mockguarden can launch acidic spores from its above-ground appendages, further augmenting its offensive capabilities.
        
        The acidic spores secreted by the Mockguarden serve a dual purpose. Primarily, they act as a potent digestive enzyme, designed to break down and decompose the prey's body upon contact. The mycelium network eagerly absorbs the resulting nutrients, fueling its growth and sustaining its existence. However, the unique properties of these spores and acid have caught the attention of skilled metalworkers.
        
        Metalworkers have discovered the remarkable applications of the Mockguarden's acidic spores in their craft. From rust removal to the intricate embellishment of armor, the acid's corrosive properties have proven valuable. Some smiths claim that when used in the treatment of metals, the Mockguarden's acid contributes to the creation of higher quality steel, enhancing its durability and strength. The adventurous and enterprising few brave the dangers of harvesting these unique resources, harnessing their potential in the realm of craftsmanship.
        
        The Mockguarden stands as a testament to the marvels and perils that exist within the natural world. Its ability to adapt, ensnare, and utilize acidic spores showcases its formidable nature. While it presents a formidable challenge to those who cross its path, it also offers intriguing opportunities for those who dare to explore its enigmatic properties and continues to intrigue and captivate the minds of scholars, adventurers, and craftsmen alike.

        *image images/Mogfish.webp
        Mogfish are dangerous creatures that live in very muddy areas and are big enough to eat an elf. They have dorsal fins along their back and the some of the species have been seen with a long tether on their head that has a glowing orb at the end of it. This orb can mimic the light of torches, making people think there is a person deep in the forest or there is a town in that direction. However, there have been sightings of mogfish without this tether. It is theorized that these are the males.
        
        The Mogfish with orbs will stay in the mud with the orb above ground. They wait for an unsuspecting victim to walk over them, then they will open their huge maw to ensnare the unsuspecting victim and suck them in. The rest have to find other ways to get food. These ones will team up with will-o-wisps to mimic the light the other mogfish have. 
        
        If you manage to get away, they will climb out of the mud and chase you down. They move really slow, but they can jump far distances. The best way to out run them is to keep something tall between you and it. They will have to get around the object as they can not jump high enough to get over most trees. If you manage to kill one, the orb can be used to create a magical ointment to make whatever it is applied to have a temporary glow.

        Will-o-wisps are glowing orbs, usually seen floating above the ground in swamps. Their glow  can mimic a torch light, so many people mistake it as a person or a nearby town. They are mischievous little creatures and will lead their victims into trouble. Off cliffs, into tunnels, it is even said that they help the mogfish get food. When they are almost caught or have gotten their victim where they wanted them, they will stop glowing. They will turn basically invisible and watch what happens to their victims. It is rumored that they feed off of the misery of their victims.
        
        It is unknown where they came from There have been many theories over the years, but no one knows for sure. Some believe that they hover over treasure to protect it, others think they are children who have gotten lost in the forest. Some think it’s the ghosts of the people taken by the rot. None of these theories have been proven and no one who went to discover the real reason ever came back. 
        
        There have been rumored sightings of wisps right before the rot invades the town. As of yet, there has been no confirmed relationship between the two.

        *label codex_hl_Teville_City
        [head]Teville (City)[/head]
        The capital city Teville is located by the Ironmount mountains on the west side of the country Teville. The capital is broken up into ten different districts. Each district is split up depending on the wealth of the people living in it. With four slums and a castle amongst the city, there is something for everyone.
        
        Starting from the top is the castle. In the castle lives the King of the country. They are the ones running and taking care of their county. Not very many among the common populace have seen the inside, but rumor has it an entire war-room is dedicated to keeping an eye on the Rot within the nation’s borders.. Next is Lowrock. This is where most of the middle-class live and where The Beggar’s Tavern is located, a famous pitstop for many mercenaries and adventuring parties. Most other shops and taverns can also be found in this district. 
        
        The Old District is where you can find the largest temple in the city. It is said to be the very first temple and the foundation of Teville. Right next to it is the docks. This is where the largest melting pot can be seen within the city and where most outside trades happen. Then there is Noblicar’s Road. The district that produces anything from the weapons the army uses to the wagons people travel with.
        
        Heathergateis named after the wife of a past King who died during childbirth. Her daughter, Dianica, became the first ruling Queen of the nation and a great ruler. In the local park you can find statues of great war heroes who made sacrifices for their country. Among them you can find Dianica’s mother Heather. Pelor’s Performance Centre can also be found here. Formerly known as The Bone Bleachers in a time when they were once used for vicious gladiatorial combat, here you can watch yearly battles as knights are pitted against each other. With ample healers and healing potions, this event is one of the safest ones in the country as well as the most popular.
        
        The Six Lodges is the nicest of the outside slums. It has six large inns, each famous in their own right, and is the second biggest slum in the city of Teville. The biggest goes to the Goldensprawl. Far from the glory of the Six Lodges sector of the city, Goldensprawl is still much nicer than the seedier areas of the city. It got its name from how the sun hits the buildings in the morning, making it look like it's showered in gold. There is also a rumor going around that the true birthplace of Teville (the founder of the kingdom) is hidden somewhere in here.
        
        Next is Woolrock, the second nicest slum. Here you will find a lot more elves, dwarves, and gnomes roaming the streets. With many shrines dedicated to their gods and some of the nicer buildings in the area. The worst place in the city is Ratbowl. Ratbowl has the highest crime rate and the worst people. A thieve’s guild has a heavy presence here, and not much attention is paid to crimes that occur within its streets. Not a place you would want to visit on your next trip to Teville.

        Summerlight is a small farming village east of Davenport. It is placed right at an intersection between Frountierwood, Cavecross, and the road to Davenport. This makes it a popular location for travelers to stay during their travels. Surprisingly, not a lot happens in this small town. The most exciting thing is when the traveling dwarven bakers come to visit.
        
        In recent history, the biggest thing to happen was a jackaloid attack. A loose jackaloid found its way to the forest of Frontierwood, where two little kids were playing. One of the kids was bit and the other tried to save them. It is unknown what happened to the one who lived as they disappeared a few years later.

        Gnomes are the shortest of the races, and the most intelligent. Many gnomes have been seen using arcane magic after years of practicing. They have no known head location, instead they stay in the cities and towns built by the other races. Seemingly because it let’s them have more time to study their chosen craft. Whatever their craft, they are known to dedicate their entire lives to it. From clockmaking to shoemaking to studying the arcane.

        Humans are taller than dwarves and gnomes. Some of them are as bulky as a dwarf and others are as thin as an elf. They’re seen all across Teville and are one of the more resilient races. They aren’t immune to anything, they have been seen surviving seemingly impossible things that confuse the other races. They are also the most common race across the land and are the leaders of many kingdoms.
