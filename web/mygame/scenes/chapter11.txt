    You and Rip reach the walls of the town. You can see the taller buildings on fire and falling apart. The roof of the tower closest to the wall looks like it is about to cave in.
    
    The front of the wall isn’t doing much better. Half of the gate has fallen over as if someone barged through it. You can even see muddy footprints across the top of the gate.
    
    You run up to the gate and look into the village. Despite seeing the buildings on fire, looking at everything that has happened is worse than you imagined.
    
    Many buildings have pieces taken off of them, like someone was trying to find a weapon of any sort. There is debris everywhere with paper and wooden chips scattered about. Worst of all, are the bodies. Many you recognize as former neighbors or villagers you’ve done work for.

    Rip clasps a hand on your shoulder before walking into the village, you follow after him.
    
    The two of you walk around, looking for any survivors. You look into a house, only to see broken furniture. The fire hasn’t reached this section of the building yet, but it is starting to poke through from the second floor. There are no hiding spots you can see for someone to be trapped and the fire has started taking over the staircase.
    
    You turn back out and look for Rip. You see him exiting a building with a grim look on his face.
    
    “There’s no one here. Everyone in this part of town has already left or is dead. We need to go farther into town if-”

    A loud explosion is heard coming from the center of town. You and Rip look at each other before running towards the center of town.
    
    Along the way you pass a familiar building. The one that you found Lord Odel in.
    
    The building looks like it took a lot of damage. The door is off its hinges and there is a stick poking out of a broken window.
    
    As you pass the building you run into another person. A familiar priestess, the one you saw when this all began.
    
    *page_break
    
    “Hey!” You shout. She turns around and sees you and Rip running towards her.
    
    “What are you doing here?” She asks, running up to both of you.
    
    “Could ask you the same thing. Shouldn’t you be at your temple?” Rip asks her.
    
    “On patrol, but that doesn’t matter. I need to stop the source of all this.” Cel returns to running towards the center of town. You and Rip follow her.

    You run by the graveyard gate and see another explosion towards the center of town. You take a frantic look around before recognizing exactly where you are. 
    
    “This way!” You shout before running through the alleyways. Rip and Cel follow close behind you.
    
    You remember running through these alleys as a child not long after Reese passed. You were trying to find somewhere, anywhere to hide away from people. Looking back, you wonder if everyone was pretending to not notice you.
    
    Shaking your head, you look up and see that some of the buildings are on fire. Only sections of the roofs were on fire, but it was spreading fast. 
    
    *page_break
    
    Looking down an alleyway, you see a group of people running back towards the graveyard. As you were turning to look back in front of you, you bump into something. You would have fallen down if Rip didn’t catch you.
    
    “Turn back!” The person you bumped into shouted. “It’s not safe here! The- the ichor-swogs are here.”
    
    “Icor-swogs? The threat was taken care of months ago.” Cel mumbles.
    
    “They were led here by a priest looking guy who said he would help. There’s no time to explain. I’m getting out of here and I suggest you do the same.” After that the person pushes past you and Rip and runs down the path.
    
    *page_break
    
    You look at Rip and Cel. “What do we do?”
    
    “We help, get as many people out of here as possible.” Rip explains before taking out his sword and running towards town square.
    
    You and Cel follow him. You bring out your dagger and hope that it’ll be enough.

            You look at the library and have a difficult time seeing the inside. The glass is badly scorched and the door is closed. From what you can see, there is a fire spreading inside. You mourn the loss of the books.

        As you look at the buildings, a roof in the distance caves in. You look at your companions, both of them have worried expressions.

        You look towards the center of town square, there are rocks and wooden bits everywhere covered in gray dust. Mixed in with the rubble are destroyed wooden barrels. The metal bands have been snapped and you realize that the wooden bits must have come from the barrels.

        Dwarves use these barrels to transport cargo, mostly food or water. You have never seen them transport something that could do this.

        Staring at the destroyed barrels, you see a line within the dust leading to an alleyway. Walking towards the alley, you hear a huge explosion coming from down it.

    You run down the alleyway and find a dwarf standing in the middle of the alley with a barrel. Before you can do anything, they throw the barrel down another alley before running away.

                “Jackaloids? Here? We need to move. Why did you run off if there are such dangerous creatures here?” Cel says slightly out of breath.

                “I saw a dwarf. They were throwing barrels at ichor-swogs. I chased after them to ask what happened, but they got away.” You explained, looking down slightly.

                “We need to get going. There are too many of them” Cel explains as she holds out her hand.

                You nod as you grab her hand and stand up.

                “Why did you leave the group?” Cel asks.

                “I saw a dwarf. They were throwing barrels at ichor-swogs. I chased after them to ask what happened, but they got away.” You explained, looking down slightly.

            “STOP!” Cel shouts.

            You look up at her as a part of the building falls onto the jackaloid. The explosions must have weakened the supports.

            There is no way across. The rubble is too tall and has too many sharp points to safely climb over at night.

            “Get back to Rip, I’ll go around! I know this down better than I know my own name!” You shout over the wall.

            “Be careful! There is no saying what is out here!” Cel shouts back before you hear footsteps running away.

            Rip and Cel follow close behind you before reaching the start of the alley. The three of you look down the alleyway and see the dwarf holding a barrel. 

            Rip takes a step forward when the dwarf sets the barrel on fire and throws it down a different alleyway. This makes Rip stop his movements and you freeze up.

            The dwarf runs away and Rip runs up to the alley. He looks down at it and takes a step back.

            “Ichor-swogs! We need to move!” Rip shouts before running after the dwarf.

            Cel follows after quickly follows after. You take a moment to process everything and in that moment a jackaloid jumps out at you.

                You quickly run over to your dagger, but as soon as you are about to help Cel-

                “Stay there!” He shouts as he pushes back the jackaloid.

            You finish putting on your mask and grab for your dagger. Just as you unsheath it, a jackaloid jumps out at you. You quickly parry it and take a few steps back to gain some distance.

            Rip and Cel follow close behind you before reaching the start of the alley. The three of you look down the alleyway and see the dwarf holding a barrel. 

            Rip takes a step forward when the dwarf sets the barrel on fire and throws it down a different alleyway. This makes Rip stop his movements and you freeze up.

            The dwarf runs away and Rip runs up to the alley. He looks down at it and takes a step back.

            “Ichor-swogs! We need to move!” Rip shouts before running after the dwarf.

            Cel follows after quickly follows after. You take a moment to process everything and in that moment a jackaloid jumps out at you.

                You slice off the jackaloids head with your dagger. You look behind it and see that Cel was taking care of her own jackaloid. 

                You take a step to help her when-

                “Stay there!” She shouts as she uses her divine magic to push back the jackaloid.

                You freese your movements and look at her in confusion when a part of a building falls in front of you. The explosions must have weakened the supports.

                There is no way across. The rubble is too tall and has too many sharp points to safely climb over at night.

                “Get back to Rip, I’ll go around! I know this down better than I know my own name!” You shout over the wall.

                “Be careful! There is no saying what is out here!” Cel shouts back before you hear footsteps running away.

            *else
                The jackaloid lunges at you, in your block, it manages to take a hold of your dagger and pull it away.

                You are backing away when something pushes it away, you look over and see Cel looking in your direction while dealing with her own jackaloid.

                You quickly run over to your dagger, but as soon as you are about to help Cel-

                “Stay there!” She shouts as she uses her divine magic to push back the jackaloid.

                You freese your movements and look at her in confusion when a part of a building falls in front of you. The explosions must have weakened the supports.

                “Be careful! There is no saying what is out here!” Cel shouts back before you hear footsteps running away.

*elseif (faction = "divine") and (cel_path = "good")
    You run down the alleyway and find a dwarf standing in the middle of the alley with a barrel. Before you can do anything, they throw the barrel down another alley before running away.

    You decide to:
    *fake_choice
        #Run over and help.
            You case after the dwarf. As you run by the alley you see where the barrel landed.

            The walls have a dark dust across them and the ground is covered in many tiny creatures. Creatures that have brought their surviving brethren and began to pile up.

            “Ichor-swogs,” you mutter before resuming your chase, digging in your pocket for a mask.

            When you catch up to the dwarf, you see them with their sword out, staring down an alley. As you are about to call out, a jackaloid jumps out at the dwarf. The dwarf uses their sword to push the jackaloid away and slash at its arm.

            You finish putting on your mask and grab for your dagger. Just as you unsheath it, a jackaloid jumps out at you. You quickly parry it and take a few steps back to gain some distance.

                After you win the battle, you look around for the dwarf, only for them to be gone. You move your foot towards the alley you saw them go down, when you hear footsteps behind you.

                “${name}!”

                You turn around and see Ivy running towards you.

                “${name}! Where did you freaking go?” Ivy calls out.

                “I’m over here! Be careful there are jackaloids!” You reply as you run towards her.

                “Jackaloids?! We need to get out of here! We don’t have the numbers for this. Why did you leave us anyways?” Ivy asks slightly out of breath.

                “I saw a dwarf. They were throwing barrels at ichor-swogs. I chased after them to ask what happened, but they got away.” You explained, looking down slightly.

                “While I am glad you were going around helping people, you don’t go off by yourself. You are lucky it was just one jackaloid.” Ivy shakes her head before leading you down the path.

            *else
                You get knocked down by the jackaloid, thankfully it just hit your bag.

                As you look around for a means to escape, you see the jackaloid’s head get chopped off. You look up and see that it’s Ivy.

                “You idiot, we need to leave. Now.” Ivy explains as she holds out his hand.

                You nod as you grab his hand and stand up.

                “Where were you trying to get to anyways?” Ivy asks.

                “I saw a dwarf. They were throwing barrels at ichor-swogs. I chased after them to ask what happened, but they got away.” You explained, looking down slightly.

                “While I am glad you were going around helping people, you don’t go off by yourself. You are lucky it was just one jackaloid.” Ivy shakes her head before leading you down the path.

            As you take a step to follow, a jackaloid jumps out between you two. You move your hand to grab at your dagger when-

            “STAY!” Ivy shouts.

            You look up at her as a part of the building falls onto the jackaloid. The explosions must have weakened the supports.

            There is no way across. The rubble is too tall and has too many sharp points to safely climb over at night.

            “Get back to Rip, I’ll go around! I know this down better than I know my own name!” You shout over the wall.

            “You better! Don’t get yourself killed out there!.” Ivy shouts back before you hear footsteps running away.

        #Ask Ivy and Rip what to do.
            “Ivy! Rip! There is someone over here!” You shout and run towards the alleyway.

                You quickly run over to your dagger, but as soon as you are about to help Ivy-

                “Stay there!” She shouts as she uses her divine magic to push back the jackaloid.

You stare at the pile of burning wood before turning around, the footsteps getting quieter and quieter. 

“I should be able to follow this alleyways back to the market.” You mutter to yourself, walking into the second alley.

You look around, keeping an eye out for jackaloids or ichor-swogs. Many of the buildings have broken windows or holes in the walls. Some balconies and roofs have begun to collapse.

“How did this happen and why here? This is a peaceful town where nothing of importance happens. The most eventful thing has been Lord Odel’s visit then murder.” You sigh and look at the ground, spotting a person. 

They’re twitching. You stand over them and you can see them twitching, but you can’t tell if they are breathing.

“Hey? Hey, are you alright?” You ask, crouching down.

The person snaps up and tries to grab at you, you fall over and roll away before getting up. You look at the person, their skin is gray and there is a feral look in their eyes. 

You back up before sprinting down the alley. “Something isn’t right here. That- that person isn’t… They aren’t…” 

*page_break

You frantically look down the alleys for a path, some way to get out of here. Every pathway is blocked by rubble or has those creatures down them.

When you find a clear path, you make a sharp turn down it, only to notice a glint of gold down it. As you get closer, you notice that it’s a person, a very familiar person.

*if (faction = "merc")
    It’s that knight that led the fight at Lindow. The Zealot, if you remember correctly. You begin running towards him when you notice something is wrong.

    His bright golden armor is covered in a black goo that seems to be coming from underneath the armor. He is also stumbling with every step, like he is having trouble walking.

    He turns to look at you and you can see that his skin has also grayed, but there is still the light of life in his eyes. 

    You freeze. He is missing an arm and the stump where it used to be is oozing the black goo, splatting on the ground when it builds up.

*elseif (faction = "divine")
    It’s the Zealot! You begin to run towards him for help, when you notice something is wrong.

    His bright golden armor is covered in a black goo that seems to be coming from underneath the armor. He is also stumbling with every step, like he is having trouble walking. 

    He turns to look at you and you can see that his skin has also grayed, but there is still the light of life in his eyes.

    You freeze. The arm he chopped off is oozing the black goo, splatting on the ground when it builds up.

    “It wasn’t enough…” You say in horror as your eyes widen.

*page_break

As you stare at the Zealot, a humanoid creature stumbles in-front of you. You quickly snap out of your transe before realizing that you are surrounded.

Frantically looking around, you see that one of the buildings is missing a wall. You quickly run into the building and search for a place to go. The upstairs is on fire and there is rubble all around.

Without having anywhere else to go, you begin climbing the stairs, hoping that the fire will ward off these creatures.

When you reach the top of the stairs, there is a small room where the roof has caved in. You run to the hole in the roof and see the damage.

*page_break

The creatures are stumbling through the village, buildings are falling, and everything is on fire.

Frantically looking for where to go next, you see the pathway you and Reese created is still stable. You run over to it and use the pathway to run across a few buildings before finding a safe place to get down.

Looking around at where you are, you see that you are at the front gate. Half of the gate has fallen and the guard tower is on fire.

*if (faction = "merc")
    You run out of the gate before looking back inside, praying that Rip and Cel made it out alright.

*elseif (faction = "divine") and (cel_path = "good")
    You run out of the gate before looking back inside, praying that Rip and Cel made it out alright.
