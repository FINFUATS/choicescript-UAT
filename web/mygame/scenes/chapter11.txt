    You and Rip reach the walls of the town. You can see the taller buildings on fire and falling apart. The roof of the tower closest to the wall looks like it is about to cave in.
    
    The front of the wall isn’t doing much better. Half of the gate has fallen over as if someone barged through it. You can even see muddy footprints across the top of the gate.
    
    You run up to the gate and look into the village. Despite seeing the buildings on fire, looking at everything that has happened is worse than you imagined.
    
    Many buildings have pieces taken off of them, like someone was trying to find a weapon of any sort. There is debris everywhere with paper and wooden chips scattered about. Worst of all, are the bodies. Many you recognize as former neighbors or villagers you’ve done work for.

    Rip clasps a hand on your shoulder before walking into the village, you follow after him.
    
    The two of you walk around, looking for any survivors. You look into a house, only to see broken furniture. The fire hasn’t reached this section of the building yet, but it is starting to poke through from the second floor. There are no hiding spots you can see for someone to be trapped and the fire has started taking over the staircase.
    
    You turn back out and look for Rip. You see him exiting a building with a grim look on his face.
    
    “There’s no one here. Everyone in this part of town has already left or is dead. We need to go farther into town if-”

    A loud explosion is heard coming from the center of town. You and Rip look at each other before running towards the center of town.
    
    Along the way you pass a familiar building. The one that you found Lord Odel in.
    
    The building looks like it took a lot of damage. The door is off its hinges and there is a stick poking out of a broken window.
    
    As you pass the building you run into another person. A familiar priestess, the one you saw when this all began.
    
    *page_break
    
    “Hey!” You shout. She turns around and sees you and Rip running towards her.
    
    “What are you doing here?” She asks, running up to both of you.
    
    “Could ask you the same thing. Shouldn’t you be at your temple?” Rip asks her.
    
    “On patrol, but that doesn’t matter. I need to stop the source of all this.” Cel returns to running towards the center of town. You and Rip follow her.
    
*elseif (faction = "merc") and (CH10_ending = "graveyard")
    
    You run by the graveyard gate and see another explosion towards the center of town. You take a frantic look around before recognizing exactly where you are. 
    
    “This way!” You shout before running through the alleyways. Rip and Cel follow close behind you.
    
    You remember running through these alleys as a child not long after Reese passed. You were trying to find somewhere, anywhere to hide away from people. Looking back, you wonder if everyone was pretending to not notice you.
    
    Shaking your head, you look up and see that some of the buildings are on fire. Only sections of the roofs were on fire, but it was spreading fast. 
    
    *page_break
    
    Looking down an alleyway, you see a group of people running back towards the graveyard. As you were turning to look back in front of you, you bump into something. You would have fallen down if Rip didn’t catch you.
    
    “Turn back!” The person you bumped into shouted. “It’s not safe here! The- the ichor-swogs are here.”
    
    “Icor-swogs? The threat was taken care of months ago.” Cel mumbles.
    
    “They were led here by a priest looking guy who said he would help. There’s no time to explain. I’m getting out of here and I suggest you do the same.” After that the person pushes past you and Rip and runs down the path.
    
    *page_break
    
    You look at Rip and Cel. “What do we do?”
    
    “We help, get as many people out of here as possible.” Rip explains before taking out his sword and running towards town square.
    
    You and Cel follow him. You bring out your dagger and hope that it’ll be enough.

    You turn to look at Cel and see her standing over a body. It’s of a little girl.
    
    You walk up to her and get her attention. “Come on, there is no one we can save here. It looks like most of them ran out the front gate. Let’s go-”

    As you pass the building, you see a familiar figure. A tall man with a green cloak and a dagger strapped to his side. He reminds you of that mercenary you saw many months ago.

    “Hey!” You shout. He turns around and sees you and Cel running towards him.
    
    “You need to go back! It’s too dangerous here!” He shouts at the two of you.
    
    “We’re here to help! We’re from the temple!” Cel replies.
    
    The mercenary shakes his head before returning his focus to town square. You and Cel follow after him.

    Cel runs up the path, you and Rip follow her. You bring out your dagger and hope that it’ll be enough.

    You turn to look at Ivy and see her investigating the outside of a building. You walk on over and see that she is staring at a guard with a bloody sword.

    Before you can respond, another explosion is heard.
