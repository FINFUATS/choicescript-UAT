*label CH_BGN
Your name… it’s ${name}, isn’t it? Well, of course it is. ${name}’s an interesting name, wouldn’t you say?

This is not a page break, however…

*page_break
This should be a page break. Is it? Well, we don’t know.
I wonder, what’s your preference between skills… Do you like [b][color=${bcolor}](Brawn)[/color][/b]? Or, perhaps, [b][color=${ccolor}](Cunning)[/color][/b]. Maybe you like to bounce all along the walls, and favor [b][color=${acolor}](Agility)[/color][/b]?
*fake_choice
    #I favor [b][color=${bcolor}](Brawn)[/color][/b]...
        Oh? You favor brawn?
    #I favor [b][color=${acolor}](Agility)[/color][/b]...
        Oh? Do you favor agility?
    #I favor [b][color=${ccolor}](Cunning)[/color][/b]...
        Oh? You favor cunning?
I see… I think I’m really getting to know you.

Alright, well, here, how about you ask me some questions?
*temp X 1
*temp Y 1
*temp Z 1
*temp Q 0
*label Q_Loop
What have you? (Branches to Q_Loop, SC2, and finish)
*fake_choice
    *selectable_if (X=1) #Who are you?
        Well, the better question is, who are you, (player_name)?
        *set X 0
        *set Q Q + 1
        *goto Q_LOOP
    *selectable_if (Y=1) #Why are you?
        Well, the better question is, who are you, (player_name)?
        *set Y 0
        *set Q Q + 1
        *goto Q_LOOP
    *selectable_if (Z=1) #What are you?
        Well, the better question is, who are you, (player_name)?
        *set Z 0
        *set Q Q + 1
        *goto Q_LOOP
    *selectable_if (Q=3) #I’m out of questions.
        Well, then, let’s continue. You have a battle ahead.
        *goto SC2
    #I’d rather not speak to you.
        Well, I’d rather not speak to you either, then.
        *finish
    #Can I just play the game?
        *goto_scene chapter1
        
*label SC2
Well, that sure was a riveting conversation.

*page_break
This is split into multiple pages.

That’s not an accident.

It’s to prove that it’s possible!

So, I have a new question for you now.

Would you rather fight, or prove your skills?
*fake_choice
    #I want a fight!
        *goto CMB
    #I want skills!
        *goto SKL
        
*label SKL
Oh. Well, that sure is boring. Well, fine, then. I’ll be checking your skills. You get to pick which one.
Choose wisely; if it’s out of shape, you’re done here.
*fake_choice
    #Strength
                *if (strength = 2)
                  *goto SKL_W
        *goto SKL_L
    #Stealth
                *if (stealth = 2)
                  *goto SKL_W
        *goto SKL_L
    #Knowledge
                *if (knowledge = 2)
                  *goto SKL_W
        *goto SKL_L

*label SKL_L
Loser
*finish

*label SKL_W
Winner!
*finish

*label CMB
Ah, so you’ve picked the fun option, then? Good, good…
*temp fight 
*rand fight 1 100

*if (fight > 50)
    This is what happens when you win
    *finish

*else
    This is what happens when you lose
    *finish
