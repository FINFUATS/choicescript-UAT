	#Mother will have it out for you if you do not help with chores.

The marketplace is a sprawling area centered in downtown. Merchants of all races are busy milling about. Color tents and intricately carved carts are strategically placed throughout the “main street” creating a competing cacophony of noises and shouting from merchants peddling their goods.

As you leisurely gaze upon the various booths of food, a tall Elf stops you and asks, “ Hey ${name} what are you doing here by yourself?”
*choice
	#“Mother needs me to pick up grain, eggs, and potatoes for supper tonight.”
		“Ah yes,” says the Elf. “While I do not have everything you
		need, I know that gruff man has the remaining goods you
		require. Go see them first and I’ll have the rest of what you
		need by the time you get back.”
		*page_break
		You come across the stall the elf pointed you to. The gruff man
		hands you a stuffed bag. You confusingly open the bag to
		find the rest of the ingredients that the Elf didn't have. The man holds his hand out expecting payment.
		handing the crops to the man in the stall to pay for the sack,
		you swiftly make your way through the crowds towards the elf.
		*page_break
		The elf hands you another sack with a smile and asks for the
		bushel of small herbs as payment. You hand the herbs to the

		You head back after grabbing ingredients and paying in
		awkward silence.

		can make a deal.”
